# TuckerMPI_for_seismic_data
parallel Tucker tensor decomposition used for seismic data compression

# Attension
the code is forked from https://gitlab.com/tensors/TuckerMPI

# Major Changes
the code has modified into a function that can be called by other program to achieve online compression, so it can not be used by independent compilation; if you want a independent version of TuckerMPI, you can refer to https://gitlab.com/tensors/TuckerMPI;

# Acknowledge
we would like to thank that Grey Ballard, Tamara Kolda, Hemanth Kolla, Woody Austin, Alicia Klinvex, Casey Battaglino.
